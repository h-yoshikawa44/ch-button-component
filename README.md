<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![overview](/screenshot/overview.png)

I've been using UI component libraries for the most part.
This time, I challenged myself to create a component from scratch using emotion and write the style.

I'm not used to starting from scratch, so it took me a long time to implement just this, but I'm glad I was able to give it some form.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

Base
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)：14.16.0
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)：4.3.2
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)：17.0.2
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)：10.2.3

Other major libraries
- [emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
- [emotion-icons](https://emotion-icons.dev/)
- [csx](https://typestyle.github.io/#/colors)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- [x] User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable the button
- [x] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [x] User story: I can have different button sizes
- [x] User story: I can have different colors
- [x] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] User story: I can still access all button attributes
- [x] User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough

## How To Use

## learned/improved
- Basic usage of emotion
- How to do a Grid layout
- How to calculate the contrast ratio and make the text color suitable for the background color.
- How to create a generic, small component from scratch without relying on a UI component library(It's still a very deep thing...)
